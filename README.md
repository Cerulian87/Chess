# Chess

This has been a semester long project in order to make an online chess game.
Thus far, the chess game itself works fairly well with a bug I haven't yet fixed that seems to crash sometimes if a knight is in a space next to the opposing king.
Still need to implement socket.io in order to allow multiple clients to play.
